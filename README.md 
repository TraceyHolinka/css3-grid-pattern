# CSS3 Grid Pattern
## Version 1.0

Created by Tracey Holinka (https://traceyholinka.com/) April 2017.
Use CSS Custom properties to create the most common design grids.

CSS3 Grid is supported by:
Chrome 57+
Firefox 53+
IE 10+
IOS Safari 10.3+
Android Chrome 57+

IE does not have a gap property so the gaps are represented by a column. For example a 4 column mobile grid having 3 column gaps is represent by a total of 7 columns.

1 column 1 gap 1 column 1 gap 1 column 1 gap 1 column

To represent 4 columns with whitespace gaps:

column 1: <code>grid-column: 1</code>
column 2: <code>grid-column: 3</code>
column 3: <code>grid-column: 5</code>
column 4: <code>grid-column: 7</code>

This grid is fully responsive by using <code>fr</code> for columns while gaps are static. Mobile view are a 4 column grid. Tablet and above is a 12 column grid.
